# JMLAnnotations
The Java annotations defined by JML. These can be used in place of JML modifiers (e.g. `@Pure` for `/*@ pure */`).
If so, then the Java program will need the annotation definitions from here to link in.
The jmlruntime.jar produced by building the OpenJML repo contains these annotations.
